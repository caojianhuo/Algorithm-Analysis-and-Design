# Algorithm-Analysis-and-Design（算法设计与分析）

## 课程简介/体会

+ **所属大学**：北京航空航天大学计算机学院开设的本科生课程（也有Mooc）

+ **先修要求：**数据结构、离散数学

+ **难度：**⭐⭐⭐⭐

+ **参考教材：**
  + Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.). by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein (CLRS)
  + Algorithms.  by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani (DPV)
  + Algorithm Design. by Kleinberg and Tardos (KT)
  + The Art of Computer Programming. by Donald E. Knuth
  + Concrete Mathematics (2nd ed.). by Graham, Knuth, Patashnik (GKP)
  + Programming Pearls (2nd ed.). by Jon Bentley
+ **成绩占比：**
  + (30%) Four Assignments
    + Each requires designing algorithms and analyzing correctness/run time.
    + Each will take 14 days.
    + After each submission due, we will post the solution and WON’T accept any assignment.
    + Failing to do any of these will be considered PLAGIARISM, and will result in a failing grade if we detect it.
  + (10%) Project
    + Each project is completed by a group.
    + Each group needs to submit a final report and codes.
    + The topics of the project will be released by the middle of Oct.
  + (60%) Final Exam
    + It covers entire semester’s material.
+ **32学时**

作为算法设计与分析的基础课程，共介绍了分治算法、动态规划算法、贪心策略、图算法和NP完全理论
